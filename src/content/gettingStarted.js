    <u><h4>Find & Enter Events!</h4></u>
    
    <p>If you're new to the scene, it's best to start off with a weekly. Weeklies tend to be smaller tournaments and are cheap in price! You can compete, spectate, or play friendlies with others there!</p>
    <p>Check out the 'Events' tab to find events near you! If there's not one closeby listed, check our Discord or Facebook to find more events.</p>
    

    <u><h4>Rulesets</h4></u>
    
    <p>Most tournaments will use variations of similar rulesets. Examples of major PNW rulesets included below.</p>
