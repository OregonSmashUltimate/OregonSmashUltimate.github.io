    <u><h4>Find & Enter Events!</h4></u>
    <p>If you're new to the scene, it's best to start off with a weekly. Weeklies tend to be smaller tournaments and are cheap in price! You can compete, spectate, or play friendlies with others there!</p>
    <p>Check out the 'Events' tab to find events near you! If there's not one closeby listed, check our Discord or Facebook to find more events.</p>

    <u><h4>Rulesets</h4></u>
    <p>Most tournaments will use variations of similar rulesets. Examples of major PNW rulesets included below.</p>

    <u><h4>Code of Conduct</h4></u>
    <p>Tournaments usually have an entry fee which pays for the building, staffing, and winners' prizes. So long as you follow the venue rules and treat everyone with respect,
        you should be fine! Organizers usually ask individuals to also let bracket matches be played before friendly matches, so please be courteous.
