    <h2>Find & Enter Events!</h2>
    <p>If you're new to the scene, it's best to start off with a weekly. Weeklies tend to be smaller tournaments and are cheap in price! You can compete, spectate, or play friendlies with others there! Check out the 'Events' tab to find events near you! If there's not one closeby listed, check our Discord or Facebook to find more events.</p>

    <h2>Rulesets</h2>
    <p>Most tournaments will use variations of similar rulesets. Examples of major PNW rulesets included below.</p>
