<div>
<h1>Right Now</h1>
<iframe href="foo"></iframe>
<p>
This box is placeholder for a Twitch steam of a tournament going on right now. It knows it is going on right now because the Google Calandar says so, and it knows what stream to show because it's in the description for the Calandar event.
</p>

<h1>Next</h1>
<iframe href="foo"></iframe>
<p>
This box is a placeholder for our Google Calandar. By having a Google Calandar instead of a database to know upcoming tournaments, tournament hosts promoting their tournaments don't need any keys or knowlege on our website, and we don't need to do any mainteinance or changes to the website for them.
</p>

<p>How do I put my tournament on here?<br />
Ask our project manager for access (see footer for social media links). They will fill you in on our format and guidelines.</p>
